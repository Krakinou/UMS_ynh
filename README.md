## Overview

Universal Media Server is a free DLNA, UPnP and HTTP/S Media Server supporting all major operating systems, with versions for Windows, Linux and macOS.
The program streams or transcodes many different media formats with little or no configuration.
It is powered by FFmpeg, MediaInfo, OpenSubtitles, Crowdin, MEncoder, tsMuxeR, AviSynth, VLC and more, which combine to offer support for a wide range of media formats.
It was originally based on PS3 Media Server by shagrath, and started by SubJunk, an official developer of PMS, in order to ensure greater stability and file-compatibility.

Upstream source code may be found [here](https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer)

**Shipped version:** 10.4.1

## Screenshots

## Configuration

Once installed, UMS will create config file in `/home/ums/.config/UMS/`
All settings are pretty well documented. You may change them from here.

## Documentation

 * The [wiki](https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/wiki) described main settings
 * The [forum](https://www.universalmediaserver.com/forum/) has also a lot of info


## YunoHost specific features

#### Multi-user support

For now, the app support single instance only.
As there is no user management, LDAP is not requested.

The default setting will use the shared multimedia directory by default, you may change this setting in `/home/ums/.config/UMS/UMS.conf` with the setting "folders"



#### Supported architectures

* x86-64 - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/ums.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/ums/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/ums.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/ums/)

## Limitations

* Known limitations : 
 - No multiinstance
 - work only on its own subdomain (ums.mydomain.tld, not on mydomain.tld/ums)
 - No user management
 - Not tested that much

## Additional information

I added the possibility to install vlc on installation. Beware! I addn't tested it and I'm not sure it is of any use for a headless server.
Moreover, it will download a full graphical UI, so not very useful on a server...
